🏦 DODO Token
=============

[$DODO](https://www.coingecko.com/coins/dodo), DODO's native token, was created for two main functions: to incentivize growth and capture value, both of which the DODO team has always viewed as central to the design of any token economy.

DODO is a governance token that is also endowed with certain functions. DODO token holders enjoy the following benefits:

*   The right to create and vote on governance proposals (DIPs)
*   Favorable quota for IDO and Crowdpooling investment

Currently, DODO tokens have been issued on four main chains, including Ether, BNB, Arbitrum, and Aurora. The total token supply remains unchanged.

DODO Token Allocation[#](#dodo-token-allocation)
------------------------------------------------

The DODO Team distributes many DODO tokens in cost-effective incentive campaigns to help grow the platform and the community. At the same time, DODO tokens are used to capture the full value of the platform, being distributed to the most loyal DODO community members. This includes up to 60% of the total DODO token supply being set aside for community incentives.

The total DODO token supply is 1 billion, and the token distribution is as follows:

How to Buy $DODO[#](#how-to-buy--dodo)
--------------------------------------

[$DODO](https://www.coingecko.com/coins/dodo) is our native token, which is issued on Ethereum and has been mapped to other blockchains such as BSC, Arbitrum, and others.

The most direct way to buy DODO is to [visit our website](https://app.dodoex.io/).

If you are not used to using a DEX, you can also [buy it on Binance](https://www.binance.com/en/trade/DODO_USDT?layout=basic&theme=dark&type=spot).

Other Ways to Get $DODO [#](#other-ways-to-get--dodo)
-----------------------------------------------------

Besides direct purchase, you can also get DODO tokens by participating in a DODO [liquidity mining campaign](https://app.dodoex.io/earn?network=mainnet).

Distribution of DODO Tokens Across Chains[#](#distribution-of-dodo-tokens-across-chains)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Currently, the DODO protocol is supported on Ethereum, Arbitrum, Polygon, BNBChain, Optimism, Avalanche, Aurora, OKTC, Conflux eSpace, Base, Linea, Scroll, Manta and other networks, with more added in the future. Despite this distribution, the total token supply remains the same. The following are some examples of DODO token migrations to other chains:

*   BNB Chain: The team has migrated 48 million DODO tokens to the BNB mainnet
*   Arbitrum: The team has migrated 5 million DODO tokens to the Arbitrum mainnet as a result of [DIP-4](https://snapshot.org/#/dodobird.eth/proposal/QmaNx6xe2zvKTNuaneD4Jb1hxj7mLxVDM2LsufTGwJyEj6)
*   Aurora: Team has migrated 3.52 million DODOs to the Aurora network as a result of [DIP-7](https://snapshot.org/#/dodobird.eth/proposal/0x282318bfffae135187b0b2995ebc1937d0e71bfe4a73b670722c6dce62a92c59).
*   Polygon: eam has migrated 3.5 million DODOs to the Polygon(POS) network as a result of [DIP-9](https://snapshot.org/#/dodobird.eth/proposal/0x5efb7758844e23b62e81546f4e5cb4186901df581a1ec68ec44734d991fd4aab) and [DIP-14](https://snapshot.org/#/dodobird.eth/proposal/0x1db79fa64516176cfea771b3d727e148821fee4978ac709df2a0a222c4d4565f)
*   Avalanche: Team has migrated 2 million DODOs to the Avalanche network as a result of [DIP-10](https://snapshot.org/#/dodobird.eth/proposal/0xd64729f5490338d9866f9d54c7be43b4c238a3a64e2b0fa2355dcc20d37fb310)
*   Boba: Team has migrated 2 million DODOs to the Boba network as a result of [DIP-10](https://snapshot.org/#/dodobird.eth/proposal/0xd64729f5490338d9866f9d54c7be43b4c238a3a64e2b0fa2355dcc20d37fb310)

🏁 vDODO[#](#---vdodo)
----------------------

vDODO, by contrast is a membership certificate, which is set up for loyal coin holders. vDODO holders enjoy all the benefits of DODO holders, as well as:

*   A fraction of all transaction fees on DODO
*   vDODO Membership Rewards

The relationship between DODO and vDODO is as follows:

*   If you pledge 100 DODO tokens, you can mint 1 vDODO.
*   Redeeming vDODO for DODO tokens requires paying a "redemption fee".

Minting and Redeeming vDODO [#](#minting-and-redeeming-vdodo)
-------------------------------------------------------------

### Minting vDODO for Membership Rewards [#](#minting-vdodo-for-membership-rewards)

Pledging 100 DODO tokens allows you to mint 1 vDODO. vDODO tokens can be transferred or traded between users, and vDODO holders receive membership rewards.

Every new block, 12 DODO tokens are distributed proportionally to vDODO holders as a membership reward.

If you invite your friends to mint vDODO, you will receive an additional 10% of the invitee's membership reward.

Holding vDODO entitles you to receive a proportional share of 50% of the vDODO redemption fees paid by other users. The remaining 50% of redeemed vDODO tokens are permanently destroyed.

### Minting vDODO to Receive a Portion of Transaction Fee Revenue [#](#minting-vdodo-to-receive-a-portion-of-transaction-fee-revenue)

The DODO Team distributes its platform revenue around the 22nd of each month. 75% of the revenue will be repurchased through the secondary market and minted into vDODO to be directly distributed to all vDODO holders. And 25% of the revenue will be transferred to [community treasury](https://etherscan.io/address/0xab21016bd4127638b8c555e36636449b33df1c38)

### Redeeming vDODO[#](#redeeming-vdodo)

Transforming vDODO into DODO tokens, known as vDODO redemption, requires the payment of a proportional redemption fee. 50% of this refund fee will be immediately distributed to all non-redeeming vDODO holders in the form of vDODO tokens, and the remaining 50% are permanently destroyed.

However, the [DIP16](https://snapshot.org/#/dodobird.eth/proposal/0xc02cec84c294bcf38a1f6631bda776a865a7b4b23a1001621ffe75ceb705d196) community has decided to remove the vDODO redemption fee.

General FAQs[#](#general-faqs)
------------------------------

### What is DODO?[#](#what-is-dodo)

DODO is a decentralized trading platform that uses the innovative Proactive Market Maker (PMM) algorithm to provide efficient on-chain liquidity for Web3 assets, making it easy for everyone to issue and trade these assets. It provides competitive prices for DEX traders and reduces impermanent loss for liquidity providers. In addition, DODO offers a zero barrier-to-entry token issuance mechanic.

### What can I do on DODO?[#](#what-can-i-do-on-dodo)

DODO offers a variety of DeFi tools, including token trading, liquidity mining, token creation and initial liquidity, custom liquidity pool creation, and more. These tools, both DeFi staples and those created by the DODO Team, implement features that make them unparalleled in safety and efficiency, including the PMM algorithm and liquidity aggregation.

### Why the name "DODO"?[#](#why-the-name--dodo-)

The DODO founders are big fans of Nintendo's Animal Crossing game, and Dodos are a species of villager in the game. We thought they were absolutely adorable, so we named our product DODO.

DODO’s yellow bird mascot is named Maya, and even though Maya doesn't look so much like the dodos of Mauritius and she has a carrot for a mouth, we think she looks cute anyway!

### Which wallets does DODO currently support?[#](#which-wallets-does-dodo-currently-support)

### Does DODO have a token?[#](#does-dodo-have-a-token)

Yes! [$DODO](https://www.coingecko.com/coins/dodo) is our native token, which is issued on Ethereum and has been mapped to other blockchains such as BSC, Arbitrum, and others. For information on how to obtain DODO tokens, see [Get DODO Tokens](../home/token-economy#how-to-buy--dodo).

DODO also issues the loyalty token vDODO. See [below](faq---trouble-shooting#what-is-vdodo) for more information.

### How does governance work on DODO?[#](#how-does-governance-work-on-dodo)

Governance on DODO is simple: any holder of vDODO can submit a DODO Improvement Proposal, known as a [DIP](../home/token-economy/dip-record), for public consideration. After a discussion period, vDODO holders can submit their tokens (1 vDODO = 100 votes) to vote on whether they want to accept or reject the proposal. If accepted, a DIP will be implemented by the DODO Team.

DODO’s Unique Features[#](#dodo-s-unique-features)
--------------------------------------------------

### What is the PMM algorithm and how does it work?[#](#what-is-the-pmm-algorithm-and-how-does-it-work)

The [Proactive Market Maker](../product/pmm-algorithm), also known as the PMM, is DODO’s way of ensuring ample liquidity for its trading pools and other services. The PMM algorithm, a derivation of the popular AMM model, was developed by the DODO Team based on the central limit order books used in traditional finance.

The PMM algorithm works by adjusting the price curve of an asset to ensure that there is ample liquidity at the most up-to-date market price. For example, when the supply of an asset decreases, the PMM algorithm automatically increases the market price for this asset in anticipation of buying back the missing inventory from the market. This ensures that DODO trading pools have much less impermanent loss and improved capital efficiency compared to similar AMM pools.

### What is Crowdpooling?[#](#what-is-crowdpooling)

Crowdpooling, a portmanteau of the phrases "crowdfunding" and "liquidity pool", is a way to distribute tokens and initiate liquid markets that's available to everyone. Inspired by the call auction mechanism common in securities markets, Crowdpooling’s liquidity protection period and equal opportunity investment features ensure that there is no rush of experts or bot interference, like with other liquidity offering methods available today on DEXs.

### What is vDODO?[#](#what-is-vdodo)

[vDODO](../home/token-economy) is a transferable token that serves as a user's proof of membership in DODO’s loyalty program. It can be used for voting on governance proposals, getting better quotas for Crowdfunding investments, as well as claiming a portion of DODO’s trading fee revenue and exclusive member perks!

### How does DODO ensure the best price for trades?[#](#how-does-dodo-ensure-the-best-price-for-trades)

DODO monitors various liquidity sources, both those hosted by DODO that use the PMM algorithm, and others across the network. It then uses multiple smart routing algorithms, including those of 1inch, Matcha, and UniSwap, to find the best price out of all of them. This best price is what is quoted to the end user.

Common Concerns and Misconceptions[#](#common-concerns-and-misconceptions)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Are DODO smart contracts audited?[#](#are-dodo-smart-contracts-audited)

Yes, all DODO contracts have been audited by third parties! See [here](../home/security) for a full list of DODO contract audits.

### Is there impermanent loss on DODO?[#](#is-there-impermanent-loss-on-dodo)

The short answer is there is reduced impermanent loss on DODO compared to other decentralized exchanges. Liquidity providers may see their token balances go down short-term, but such losses are less severe than on other AMM platforms, most notably UniSwap.

DODO is a decentralized exchange and on-chain liquidity provider built for long-term success, and our backtests on BTC price data from April 2018 to April 2020 indicate that liquidity providers that stick to DODO are able to make 80% in net gains.

The long answer is that the kind of impermanent loss (we would prefer calling it "asset re-balancing loss", as it is much more accurate and less generic) frequently seen on other AMM platforms is not present on DODO. In one of [our earlier Medium articles](https://medium.com/dodoex/why-there-is-no-impermanent-loss-on-dodo-4d82b2b532bc), we talked about how there is "no \[AMM\] impermanent loss" on DODO, because DODO does not force liquidity providers to deposit tokens in pre-defined ratios and does not tamper with their asset allocations.

There is, however, market risk involved with liquidity provision on DODO. The biggest distinction between market risk and AMM "impermanent loss" (or asset re-balancing loss) is the fact that impermanent loss is always a loss and there is very little LPs can do to address it, if it is present. In contrast, market risk is not always manifested in losses. LPs could profit if the asset prices went up.

Liquidity Provision[#](#liquidity-provision)
--------------------------------------------

### How do I withdraw my trading fee revenue?[#](#how-do-i-withdraw-my-trading-fee-revenue)

The trading fee revenue are added to the liquidity pool in real-time. When you withdraw your funds, you will also receive your share of the fee revenue.

### Do I need to pay a fee to withdraw my funds from a liquidity pool?[#](#do-i-need-to-pay-a-fee-to-withdraw-my-funds-from-a-liquidity-pool)

In most situations, withdrawing your funds from a liquidity pool does not incur a withdrawal fee. However, if the asset allocation in a pool is not balanced, and you are withdrawing the scarcer asset, then the system will charge a withdrawal fee. This fee will be distributed to the other LPs who have provided the scarce asset, in order to incentivize their continued liquidity provision. Usually, this fee is very small, and only when the asset allocation is extremely unbalanced will it become significantly larger.

### How is the APY of a liquidity pool calculated?[#](#how-is-the-apy-of-a-liquidity-pool-calculated)

The formula for calculating the Annual Percentage Yield (APY)a of liquidity provision is (estimated annual trading volume x fee rate x 80%) divided by the total funds in the liquidity pool.

Crowdpooling[#](#crowdpooling)
------------------------------

### How is the Crowdpooling share allocated?[#](#how-is-the-crowdpooling-share-allocated)

Currently, there is no deposit threshold required to participate in a Crowdpooling campaign, you just need to hold the required token. For example, if the project requires USDT, you can participate by providing USDT at the Crowdpooling price. If too many people participated in the Crowdpooling campaign, the funds will be allocated proportionally based on the amount provided, and any excess funds will be refunded.

### What is the 'Liquidity Protection Period' in the context of Crowdpooling?[#](#what-is-the--liquidity-protection-period--in-the-context-of-crowdpooling)

After the Crowdpooling period ends, the funds and remaining tokens belong to the project initiator. These assets will be used to provide liquidity in the spot market. During the liquidity protection period, the project initiator cannot withdraw funds from the pool. After the liquidity protection period ends, the funds can be withdrawn. This safety feature was implemented to prevent rug-pull scams where a project initiator would withdraw funds immediately after getting buy-in from others, destroying the value of others' deposits.

Liquidity Mining[#](#liquidity-mining)
--------------------------------------

### Is there a trading volume threshold for liquidity mining?[#](#is-there-a-trading-volume-threshold-for-liquidity-mining)

No! As long as a trade is completed, you can get a certain proportion of $DODO tokens from the reward pool.

### How is the APR of liquidity mining calculated?[#](#how-is-the-apr-of-liquidity-mining-calculated)

The Annual Percentage Rate (APR) for liquidity mining is calculated as follows: (the reward token's reward per block \* estimated total blocks per year \* the USD price of the reward token) divided by the total funds in the mining pool.

vDODO[#](#vdodo)
----------------

### What are the benefits of holding vDODO?[#](#what-are-the-benefits-of-holding-vdodo)

vDODO is a membership token designed for loyal DODO users. By holding vDODO, you will enjoy the following benefits:

1.  Trading fee dividends
2.  vDODO membership perks
3.  Governance proposal and voting rights
4.  Increased shares for IDOs and Crowdpooling campaigns on the DODO platform
5.  Trading fee discounts

### How much is the vDODO membership reward?[#](#how-much-is-the-vdodo-membership-reward)

6 DODO tokens are released per block and awarded to vDODO holders. The reward is paid in the form of vDODO, credited in real-time and compounded. vDODO holders receive DODO membership rewards in proportion to their holdings. Inviting your friends to mint vDODO will earn you an additional 10% reward.

### Are there any restrictions on the address of the vDODO inviter?[#](#are-there-any-restrictions-on-the-address-of-the-vdodo-inviter)

When minting vDODO for the first time, you must enter an inviter address. The default inviter is the DODO team. You can choose another Ethereum address that has already minted vDODO as the inviter. The inviter cannot be changed once set.

### How do I mint vDODO?[#](#how-do-i-mint-vdodo)

Stake 100 DODO in a DODO liquidity mining contract to mint 1 vDODO.

### Is there a fee for redeeming vDODO?[#](#is-there-a-fee-for-redeeming-vdodo)

To redeem your vDODO for DODO, you need to pay a proportional exit fee. This exit fee will be distributed in vDODO form to all remaining vDODO holders in real-time, and is calculated based on the DODO Loyalty Index. The "DODO Loyalty Index" is defined as "vDODO supply \* 100" divided by the "circulating supply of DODO ". The higher the loyalty index, the lower the exit fee, as follows:

*   When the loyalty index is greater than 0.5, and more than 50% of the circulating DODO is staked, the exit fee reaches the minimum of 5%.
*   As the loyalty index decreases, the exit fee gradually increases.
*   When the loyalty index is less than 0.1, and less than 10% of the circulating DODO is pledged, the exit fee reaches the maximum of 15%.

### How is the circulating supply of DODO calculated?[#](#how-is-the-circulating-supply-of-dodo-calculated)

The circulating supply of DODO is calculated by subtracting the DODO amounts in the following addresses from the total DODO supply. The DODO Team will update this list in real-time when there are changes to the locked tokens contract.

Without limiting the foregoing, we do not represent or warrant that the App (including any related data) will be uninterrupted, available at any particular time or error-free. Further, we do not warrant that errors in the App are correctable or will be corrected.

### 4.2 DISCLAIMER ABOUT INFORMATION ACCURACY[#](#4-2-disclaimer-about-information-accuracy)

You are aware that we rely on third-party sources for information about certain digital tokens listed on the App and we have the right to choose, change and remove any third-party information source at our discretion. Digital token information, including token price, is currently derived from third-party sources such as coingecko.com. We are not responsible for the quality, accuracy, timeliness, completeness or reliability of any of the digital token information on the App. You are obligated to collect sufficient information and keep yourself well informed before trading any digital tokens on the App.

### 4.3 FEATURED LISTS[#](#4-3-featured-lists)

The appearance of digital tokens on any of the App’s featured lists is determined by various factors, including but not limited to their ranking on coingecko.com, performance on the App, and DODO’s policies of digital token listing. You understand that we do not endorse or promote any digital assets on any of the default lists. We have the right to add, change, update, or remove any digital tokens from any of the featured lists, or from the App at our sole discretion.

### 4.4 PAYMENTS AND FEES[#](#4-4-payments-and-fees)

Transactions on Ethereum or that otherwise involve the use of an underlying blockchain or other decentralized or permissioned infrastructure (the “Distributed Ledger Technology”) require that you pay a fee, such as “gas” charges on the Ethereum network, for the computational resources required to perform a transaction on the particular Distributed Ledger Technology (such payments and fees, “Charges”).

DODO does not currently charge any fees for your transactions on the App. However, we reserve the right to charge fees for your use of the App and adjust the pricing anytime. If such fees are imposed, we will notify you of the fees and pricing of your transaction when you authorize the transaction.

You acknowledge and agree that DODO has no control over any Distributed Ledger Technology transactions, the method of payment of any Charges, if applicable, or any actual payments of Charges, if applicable. Accordingly, you must ensure that you have a sufficient balance of the applicable Distributed Ledger Technology network tokens stored at your Distributed Ledger Technology-compatible wallet address (“Distributed Ledger Technology Address”) to complete any transaction on the Distributed Ledger Technology before initiating such transaction.

### 4.5 CUSTODY AND CONTROL OF DIGITAL TOKENS[#](#4-5-custody-and-control-of-digital-tokens)

You have full custody and control of the digital tokens in your digital wallets at all times. We do not custody your digital tokens and do not have access to, or retain the electronic private key of your digital wallet. As the owner and custodian of the digital tokens in your digital wallets, you shall bear all risk of loss of such digital tokens.

You understand that DODO is not registered or licensed by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, Securities and Exchange Commission, Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, or any financial regulatory authority, and that no financial regulatory authority has reviewed or approved the App. You further understand that DODO is not acting as an investment adviser or commodity trading adviser to any person, does not offer securities services in the United States or to U.S. persons, and that the contents of the App do not constitute advice or recommendations concerning any commodity, security or other asset.

### 4.6 RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH DIGITAL TOKENS[#](#4-6-risks-associated-with-digital-tokens)

By accessing and using the App, you represent that you understand the inherent risks associated with using cryptographic and blockchain-based systems, and that you have a working knowledge of the usage and intricacies of digital tokens such as bitcoin (BTC), ether (ETH), and other digital tokens such as those following the Ethereum Token Standard (ERC-20). DODO does not control the underlying software protocols of any digital tokens accessible on the App. You agree that we are not responsible for the operation, functionality or security of the underlying protocols and not liable for any loss of token value you may encounter due to any operating change, malfunction or failure of the underlying protocols.

-----------------------------------------

We shall not be responsible for any delay or failure in performance of the App resulted directly or indirectly from any events or circumstances beyond our reasonable control, including but not limited to, natural disaster, civil unrest, terrorism, significant market volatility and failure of Internet services, equipment or software.

15\. DISPUTE RESOLUTION AND ARBITRATION[#](#15--dispute-resolution-and-arbitration)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Please read the following section carefully because it requires you to arbitrate certain disputes and claims with DODO and limits the manner in which you can seek relief from us, unless you opt out of arbitration by following the instructions set forth below. In addition, arbitration precludes you from suing in court or having a jury trial.

You and DODO agree that any dispute arising out of or related to this Agreement is personal to you and DODO and that any dispute will be resolved solely through individual action, and will not be brought as a class arbitration, class action or any other type of representative proceeding.

Except for small claims disputes in which you or DODO seeks to bring an individual action in small claims court located in the county or other applicable jurisdiction where you reside or disputes in which you or DODO seeks injunctive or other equitable relief for the alleged unlawful use of intellectual property, you and DODO waive your rights to a jury trial and to have any dispute arising out of or related to this Agreement or the App resolved in court. Instead, for any dispute or claim that you have against DODO or relating in any way to the Services, you agree to first contact DODO and attempt to resolve the claim informally by sending a written notice of your claim (“Notice”) to DODO by email at [\[email protected\]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#01626e6f7560627541656e656e64792f686e). The Notice must include your name, residence address, email address, and telephone number, describe the nature and basis of the claim and set forth the specific relief sought. Our notice to you will be similar in form to that described above. If you and DODO cannot reach an agreement to resolve the claim within thirty (30) days after such Notice is received, then either party may submit the dispute to binding arbitration administered by the JAMS, or, under the limited circumstances set forth above, in court. All disputes submitted to JAMS will be resolved through confidential, binding arbitration before one arbitrator. Arbitration proceedings will be held in San Francisco, California, in accordance with the JAMS Comprehensive Arbitration Rules & Procedures (“JAMS Rules”). The most recent version of the JAMS Rules are available on the JAMS Site and are hereby incorporated by reference. You either acknowledge and agree that you have read and understand the JAMS Rules or waive your opportunity to read the JAMS Rules and waive any claim that the JAMS Rules are unfair or should not apply for any reason.

You and DODO agree that the enforceability of this Section 15 will be substantively and procedurally governed by the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. § 1, et seq. (the “FAA”), to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law. As limited by the FAA, these Terms and the AAA Rules, the arbitrator will have exclusive authority to make all procedural and substantive decisions regarding any dispute and to grant any remedy that would otherwise be available in court, including the power to determine the question of arbitrability. The arbitrator may conduct only an individual arbitration and may not consolidate more than one individual’s claims, preside over any type of class or representative proceeding or preside over any proceeding involving more than one individual.

The arbitrator, DODO, and you will maintain the confidentiality of any arbitration proceedings, judgments and awards, including, but not limited to, all information gathered, prepared and presented for purposes of the arbitration or related to the disputes. The arbitrator will have the authority to make appropriate rulings to safeguard confidentiality, unless the law provides to the contrary. The duty of confidentiality does not apply to the extent that disclosure is necessary to prepare for or conduct the arbitration hearing on the merits, in connection with a court application for a preliminary remedy or in connection with a judicial challenge to an arbitration award or its enforcement, or to the extent that disclosure is otherwise required by law or judicial decision.

You and DODO agree that for any arbitration you initiate, you will pay all AAA fees and costs. For any arbitration initiated by DODO, DODO will pay all AAA fees and costs.

Any claim arising out of or related to this Agreement must be filed within one year after such claim arose; otherwise, the claim is permanently barred, which means that you and DODO will not have the right to assert the claim.

You have the right to opt out of binding arbitration within 30 days of the date you first accepted the terms of this Section 15 by emailing us at [\[email protected\]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#3d5e5253495c5e497d595259525845135452). In order to be effective, the opt-out notice must include your full name and address and clearly indicate your intent to opt out of binding arbitration. By opting out of binding arbitration, you are agreeing to resolve disputes in accordance with Section 16.

If any portion of this Section 15 is found to be unenforceable or unlawful for any reason, the unenforceable or unlawful provision will be severed from this Agreement, severance of the unenforceable or unlawful provision will have no impact whatsoever on the remainder of this Section 15 or the parties’ ability to compel arbitration of any remaining claims on an individual basis under this Section 15, and to the extent that any claims must therefore proceed on a class, collective, consolidated, or representative basis, such claims must be litigated in a civil court of competent jurisdiction and not in arbitration, and the parties agree that litigation of those claims will be stayed pending the outcome of any individual claims in arbitration. Further, if any part of this Section 15 is found to prohibit an individual claim seeking public injunctive relief, that provision will have no effect to the extent such relief is allowed to be sought out of arbitration, and the remainder of this Section 15 will be enforceable.

16\. GOVERNING LAW[#](#16--governing-law)
-----------------------------------------

The interpretation and enforcement of the Agreement, and any dispute related to the Agreement or the App, will be governed by and construed and enforced in accordance with the laws of the California, as applicable, without regard to conflict of law rules or principles that would cause the application of the laws of any other jurisdiction. You agree that we may initiate a proceeding related to the enforcement or validity of our intellectual property rights in any court having jurisdiction. You agree that San Francisco, California is the proper forum for any appeals of an arbitration award or for court proceedings in the event that this Agreement’s binding arbitration clause is found to be unenforceable.
